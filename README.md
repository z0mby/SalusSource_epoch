Software project for Software Engng Fundamentals
=================================================

Our product, “epoch”, will include patient registration, visual reports, appointment scheduling, an administrative end for health care professionals, which is all user friendly and aesthetically appealing. Epoch will allow offices, ranging from pediatrics to hospitals and so on, to provide their patients with an easy way to submit their information using a easy to use application. After registering with epoch, the software will save the patients information in the system for future use as well as allow the employees to maintain records. For managers, doctors, and supervisors, features such as appointment scheduling and visual reports free up time spent on meticulous tasks to be completed effectively.

We are using a local server for this project. If you try to test the code, it will not work because of the sql connection string.
